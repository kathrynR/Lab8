  Created the Maze Reader. If you need to reference the Maze object use the get Integer[][] myMazeLayout, it was instantiated in Game.
  I made the program capable of adding a maze of any size. In the setup of game, the dimensions of the GamePanel are set to whatever the size of the rows and columns of the text file are.
  The GamePanel class contains the paintComponent.
  Realized that the blocks need to be a part of the solid object class. So I need to go back and edit that.
  
  (As of 04/06/18: This has been Fixed)FIXME: Make Blocks part of the SolidObject class
  
  TODO: Player/Block Collision
  TODO: Player/Item Collision
  TODO: Player/Side of Panel Collision
  TODO: If all items are gone, end the game, and display "You Won"

  I added in the Block class. There is an array for the Block items, and an array for the block item images. These are all instantiated in game.
  I edited the photos so that they are all 50 x 50 pixels. This messes up the quality, but it makes it easier to set the program up. Supposedly they are all transparent in the background, at least on my computer, not sure if it will keep that transparency after I upload them.
